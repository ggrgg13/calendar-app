# Individual Reflection
## Steven Lin
1. The hardest part was figuring out the real time adding and deleting of EventInstances. I ran into problems keeping track of alered event instances. After much deliberation, I decided to
abandon the functionality of altering event instances in favor of dyanmic event instances.
2. Algorithms for incrementing time. While conceptually simple, the logic and calculations were hard to keep track of. There were a lot of boilerplate and repeating code that hard to be
written, and it was very easy to lose track of exactly what had to be implemented. I found myself constantly looking back at my own documentation to make sure I implemened it correctly.
3. The thing I had most practice in was moving functions I previously thought had to be done outside the database into database stored functions.
4. Not much to add. The course structure is already good. To future students: Practice writing queries sometimes. For anything but the most complicated query design, practicing until no online
5. guides are needed is a must in my opinion.
